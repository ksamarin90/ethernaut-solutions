// Challenge description

// The goal of this level is for you to claim ownership of the instance you are given.
// Things that might help:
// - Look into Solidity's documentation on the delegatecall low level function, how it works, how it can be used to delegate operations to on-chain libraries, and what implications it has on execution scope.
// - Fallback methods
// - Method ids
